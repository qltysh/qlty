# Qlty CLI

Qlty CLI is a multi-language code linter, auto-formatter, and security scanner.

Engineering teams use Qlty CLI for static analysis and auto-formatting of all of their code using a single tool with fast, consistent results.

As a Git-aware tool, Qlty CLI makes adopting linting into the development workflow easy by limiting results to only _new_ issues.

Qlty CLI is implemented in Rust, supported by [Qlty Software](https://qlty.sh), free to use, and is published under a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) license.

## Features

- üêû Linting (for every programming language)
- üñåÔ∏è Auto-formatting
- üö® Security scanning (IaC, SAST, SCA, and more)
- üìä Complexity metrics and duplication
- üí© Maintainability smells

## Installation

Qlty CLI is available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

### Install on MacOS or Linux

```bash
curl https://qlty.sh | bash
```

### Install on Windows

```bash
powershell -c "iwr https://qlty.sh | iex"
```

## Usage

Setup Qlty within a Git repository:

```bash
cd my_repo/
qlty init
```

View a sample of lint issues:

```bash
qlty check --sample=5
```

Auto-format the codebase:

```bash
qlty fmt --all
```

Scan for code smells like duplication:

```bash
qlty smells --all
```

Review a summary of code quality metrics:

```bash
qlty metrics --all --max-depth=2 --sort complexity --limit 10
```

## Plugins

Qlty CLI is powered by a set of 40+ plugins for static analysis tools like linters, auto-formatters, and security scanners. Plugin definitions can be found in the [`plugins/linters` directory](https://github.com/qltysh/qlty/tree/main/plugins/linters).

Creating a plugin can be as easy as writing a small plugin definition TOML file. If the tool has a custom output format (instead of a standard like [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/)), then writing a simple output parser in Rust is also needed.

We also happily accept requests for new plugins via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/qltysh/qlty/issues/new/choose).

## Configuration

Qlty CLI is configured using a `.qlty/qlty.toml` file in your Git repository. You can generate a default configuration with `qlty init` and then customize it.

Read our documentation about [configuration](https://docs.qlty.sh/analysis-configuration) for more information.

## Development

Developing on Qlty CLI requires a working [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```
